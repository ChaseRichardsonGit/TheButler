{"prompt": "Sometimes I am physically tired but can’t fall asleep. How is that possible?", "completion": "This is what’s known as the tired but wired syndrome. Usually, it’s driven by stress and anxiety. Even if you’re exhausted, a racing mind can activate the “fight or flight” branch of your nervous system, making you alert and unable to fall asleep. “For us to fall asleep and stay asleep, we need to go in the opposite nervous system direction,” said Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of the best-selling book “Why We Sleep.” “We need to shift over to the calming branch of the nervous system called the parasympathetic nervous system.” If you have this experience night after night, you’ll want to do relaxation exercises before bed to quell your stress and anxiety, such as breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation or guided meditation, which we’ll discuss in more detail below."}
{"prompt": "When I put my head down at night, my thoughts and heart start racing. How can I quiet my mind and body and fall asleep?", "completion": "One of the best ways to calm your mind before bed is by doing meditation. In a 2014 study published in the journal Sleep, researchers split 54 people with chronic insomnia into groups and assigned some of them to practice mindfulness meditation. The others served as a control group. After eight weeks, the researchers found that the people assigned to practice meditation gained nearly 45 extra minutes of sleep each night, while the control group showed almost no change. The meditation group had substantial reductions in the overall severity of their insomnia. After six months, between 40 percent and 50 percent of people practicing meditation were in “remission” from their insomnia, the researchers reported. If you struggle with insomnia, the best time to do meditation is at night, said Dr. Walker. “Practicing meditation throughout the day but particularly in the evening seems to have a beneficial effect,” he said. “It helps people fall asleep faster, and they report superior quality of sleep.” If you’ve never tried meditation, don’t fret: A number of popular meditation apps have entire sections devoted to sleep, such as Calm, Headspace and Insight Timer. Most of these guided mediation apps offer free versions and trial periods, as well as premium versions that you can access with a subscription."}
{"prompt": "I’ve tried meditation without success. What else can I do?", "completion": "Another way to calm your mind is to start a worry journal. Every night, an hour or two before you go to bed, write down the concerns or anxieties that are bothering you. Studies have found that this practice helps protect mental health and reduces the time it takes to fall asleep. One reason it works is that it’s a form of catharsis. In today’s busy world, people rarely have time to stop and reflect. For some people, the only time that they get a chance to engage in quiet contemplation is when their head hits the pillow at night. “That’s the last time you should be doing reflection,” said Dr. Walker. “It leads to rumination, and at that point you’re not going to be in good shape for sleep.”"}
